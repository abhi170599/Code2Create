Data Integreity - Detecting fake certificates

PROBLEM STATEMENT : - Detecting Forged and Tampered Certificates. Digital Certificates these days can be easily faked and can be used as a false 
identity as well.


Solution:

We aim at implementing Simaese Neural Network Architecture for Visual Similarity.
The proposed Application will use deep learning to detect image Tampering by Tools such as Adobe Photoshop along with Providnig a portal for verification
of original documents.
